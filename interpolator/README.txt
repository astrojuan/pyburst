Interpolator Version:

10:
    only use accrate 0.10-0.24 (step 0.02)

11:
    only use mass 0.8, 2.0, 3.2 (step 1.2)

12:
    use both restrictions of V10,11 above

13:
    Prelim interpolator with z=0.0015

14:
    1.4 < mass < 2.6
15:
    0.65 < x < 0.77
16:
    accrate > 0.1
19:
    1.4 < mass < 2.3
20:
    same as 19 but with uncertainties forced to 2%
23:
    new models with qb=0.05
24:
    same as 23 but forced 2% uncertainties
