Version     Note
----------------
10          only use accrate 0.10-0.24 (step 0.02)
11          only use mass 0.8, 2.0, 3.2 (step 1.2)
12          use both restrictions of V10,11 above
13          Prelim interpolator with z=0.0015
14          1.4 < mass < 2.6
15          0.65 < x < 0.77
16          accrate > 0.1
19          1.4 < mass < 2.3
20          same as 19 but with uncertainties forced to 2%
23          new models with qb=0.05
24          same as 23 but forced 2% uncertainties
25          Use burst rate (rate) in place of recurrent time (dt)
26          same as 25, but with bprops 10% smaller, to test qnuc heating models
