# grids

Modules for managing grids (i.e., collections) of burst models. 

Whereas `burst_analyser` typically deals with single models, `grids` deals with groups of models, usually organised under some common aim.

Analogous to the `BurstRun` class in `burst_analyser.py`, the `Kgrid` class in `grid_analyser.py` is the primary object for interacting with model grids.
